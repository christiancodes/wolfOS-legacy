# wolfOS (legacy) - exhibitor operating system

![wolfOS in operation](wolfos-title.jpg "wolfOS 1.5 in operation")

Originally made for Hal-Con 2017, this version was updated for Spring Geequinox 2018. Played in the Lynx browser:

`sudo apt-get install lynx`

Install Nginx or the webserver of your choice and clone repo into `/var/www/html`. Start the server then run: `lynx localhost/wolfOS-legacy`

Press `o` for options; set User Mode to `Advanced` to get rid of navigation tips.
